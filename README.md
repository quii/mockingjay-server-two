# mockingjay-server-two

The sequel (re-write) of [Mockingjay-server](https://github.com/quii/mockingjay-server)

## Hopes and dreams

- I am a much better engineer compared to when I wrote MJ. It was my first Go project
- A lot of people (relatively speaking) saw value in it, and enjoyed using it, but YAML as a config choice was pure pain. Hoping to do much better here
- Address some of the shortfalls, in particular the need to have some sense of variance between how the local server works, and running the CDC against the real one. Stuff like authentication, API keys, yada yada
- Take a very strict, ATDD approach as I described in [learn go with tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/testing-fundamentals/scaling-acceptance-tests)
- Leverage example mapping to give myself focus https://github.com/quii/mockingjay-server-two/wiki/Example-mapping
